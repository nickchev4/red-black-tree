# Red Black Tree
**Overview:**

A Red/Black tree data structure programmed in java. It is implemented to sort a manually entered array of integers into ascending order.
The program corrects itself by designating nodes as red or black, and then sorting them accordingly.

**Applications:**

This program was not created for commercial use. I made this to demonstrate my knowledge of data structures, more specifically Binary
Search Trees. This is just another way to sort data, except with a self-balancing BST, it is much easier to insert data into a list
that is already sorted.

**Testing and Runtime**

All code was tested using JUnit 4 and runs in O log n.
